## Grant SSH access from server
Execute the following:
<pre>
echo <b>SSH_PUB_KEY</b> | sudo tee /home/tye/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre>

## Set zsh
Install zsh
```
apt update && apt upgrade
apt install zsh
```

Save the following as zshrc:
```
# If you come from bash you might have to change your $PATH.
# export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH


# Path to your oh-my-zsh installation.
export ZSH="$HOME/.oh-my-zsh"


# Set name of the theme to load --- if set to "random", it will
# load a random theme each time oh-my-zsh is loaded, in which case,
# to know which specific one was loaded, run: echo $RANDOM_THEME
# See https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes
ZSH_THEME="ys"


# Set list of themes to pick from when loading at random
# Setting this variable when ZSH_THEME=random will cause zsh to load
# a theme from this variable instead of looking in $ZSH/themes/
# If set to an empty array, this variable will have no effect.
# ZSH_THEME_RANDOM_CANDIDATES=( "robbyrussell" "agnoster" )


# Uncomment the following line to use case-sensitive completion.
# CASE_SENSITIVE="true"


# Uncomment the following line to use hyphen-insensitive completion.
# Case-sensitive completion must be off. _ and - will be interchangeable.
# HYPHEN_INSENSITIVE="true"


# Uncomment one of the following lines to change the auto-update behavior
# zstyle ':omz:update' mode disabled # disable automatic updates
# zstyle ':omz:update' mode auto # update automatically without asking
# zstyle ':omz:update' mode reminder # just remind me to update when it's time


# Uncomment the following line to change how often to auto-update (in days).
# zstyle ':omz:update' frequency 13


# Uncomment the following line if pasting URLs and other text is messed up.
# DISABLE_MAGIC_FUNCTIONS="true"


# Uncomment the following line to disable colors in ls.
# DISABLE_LS_COLORS="true"


# Uncomment the following line to disable auto-setting terminal title.
# DISABLE_AUTO_TITLE="true"


# Uncomment the following line to enable command auto-correction.
# ENABLE_CORRECTION="true"


# Uncomment the following line to display red dots whilst waiting for completion.
# You can also set it to another string to have that shown instead of the default red dots.
# e.g. COMPLETION_WAITING_DOTS="%F{yellow}waiting...%f"
# Caution: this setting can cause issues with multiline prompts in zsh < 5.7.1 (see #5765)
# COMPLETION_WAITING_DOTS="true"


# Uncomment the following line if you want to disable marking untracked files
# under VCS as dirty. This makes repository status check for large repositories
# much, much faster.
# DISABLE_UNTRACKED_FILES_DIRTY="true"


# Uncomment the following line if you want to change the command execution time
# stamp shown in the history command output.
# You can set one of the optional three formats:
# "mm/dd/yyyy"|"dd.mm.yyyy"|"yyyy-mm-dd"
# or set a custom format using the strftime function format specifications,
# see 'man strftime' for details.
# HIST_STAMPS="mm/dd/yyyy"


# Would you like to use another custom folder than $ZSH/custom?
# ZSH_CUSTOM=/path/to/new-custom-folder


# Which plugins would you like to load?
# Standard plugins can be found in $ZSH/plugins/
# Custom plugins may be added to $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/
# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)
# Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.
plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)
